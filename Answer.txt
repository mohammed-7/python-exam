1.In python how many types of errors are possible & define them ?
    In python two types of errors occur they can be names as : 
		1.Syntax errors
                
		2.Runtime errors
		
1. Syntax error: this is the type of error which occurs due to invalid syntax
2. Run time: This is the type  of error which also know as exceptions, this can occur when programing is done and there's an error at end user 
	-input or programming logic or memory problems.

2. What is an Exception and write the syntax of exception handling?

	An unwanted and unexpected instance that stirrs or manipulates normal flow of 
	-program is what we can say as an exception
	examples: zero div error
		  Type error
		  Value error
		  EOF Error
	       	  Name error

the syntax for exception handling : 
 	try:
	   Risky Code
	except xyz:
		handle the code or showing an alternative code.
	E.g:try:
		a=10
		b=2
		print("The div of a &b is:", a/b)
	   except:
		print("You cannt execute the program")

3) Define User-Defined Exceptions in Python Programming.
	It is also known as customised or manipulative (programmable)exceptions
	
	at some point we ourselves have to rise some of our own exceptions in program explicitly
	- to indicate that some thing went wrong this type of exceptions are known as user-defined exceptions
	 some of them are: 
		try block:
		raise keyword:
		final block:
		except block:
	try block: we write the code which may rise the query or exception
	raise block: here the its going to raise the exceptions which is already handled
	final block: this is executed even if there is an unhandled exception in a program
	except block: used to handle the exceptions.
